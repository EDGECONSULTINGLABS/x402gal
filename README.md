> Every AI inference consumes freshwater. x402GAL charges agents per call in USDC, swaps the proceeds for **HydroCoin (HYDRO)**, and retires it on **XRPL** as a verifiable water-restoration credit — fully on-chain, no intermediary.

**1 billion AI calls/day = 68 L of freshwater** — currently with zero accountability. x402GAL makes that externality programmable using primitives that already exist: x402, USDC, and XRPL.

> ⚠️ **Testnet demo only.** This is an independent hackathon-derived project. Water credits are tied to [HydroCoin's MRV Framework](https://hydrocoin.com/whitepaper) but currently issued under a custodial model. Not financial advice. No real-world carbon/water offsets are guaranteed.

> **Disclaimer:** Funds on testnet have no real-world value. HydroCoin branding and water restoration methodology are developed by [Parjana Engineering](https://parjanaengineering.com). Issuer is currently custodial.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure (copy and fill in your seeds — see Configuration below)
cp env.local.example .env.local

# 3. Run (Next.js app)
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build
```

To run a paying agent against the live server:

```bash
npm run demo:agent
```

## How it works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent<br/>(Avalanche / Base / Eth)
    participant GAL as x402GAL<br/>facilitator
    participant EVM as EVM Treasury<br/>(USDC contract)
    participant XRPL as XRPL Testnet

    Agent->>GAL: POST /api/ai/chat
    GAL-->>Agent: 402 Payment Required<br/>{ price: 0.068 mL, methodologyHash }
    Agent->>GAL: retry + X-PAYMENT header<br/>(ERC-3009 signed auth)
    GAL->>EVM: receiveWithAuthorization()<br/>pull 1 USDC → treasury
    EVM-->>GAL: ✅ Avalanche Fuji tx hash
    GAL->>XRPL: swapAndRetireHydro()<br/>HYD issued + burned
    XRPL-->>GAL: ✅ swap tx + retirement tx
    GAL-->>Agent: 200 OK + 3 on-chain receipts
```

## Verified on-chain proof

End-to-end run **live demo (updated May 2026)** — real funds, two chains:

| # | Action | Chain | Transaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | USDC pulled via ERC-3009 | Avalanche Fuji | [0xb881…7032](https://testnet.avascan.info/blockchain/c/tx/0xb88104cab2344fe38f0e00fa1bcdb041e730a1f61f45928a6ed64b23c6f17032) |
| 2 | HYD swap (issuer → treasury) | XRPL testnet | [5484EC…CB15](https://testnet.xrpscan.com/tx/5484EC649181ABE68DB1EE252F55A312520BC52C64162D5DEBEE9A5CF205CB15) |
| 3 | HYD retirement (water credit) | XRPL testnet | [4E4795…DB41](https://testnet.xrpscan.com/tx/4E479597A44755318B938DC1432C478C38302440482BCB0CA5EFE8976BDADB41) |

## Integration

### Drop-in agent fetch

*Use this if you are building an AI agent that needs to auto-pay 402s.*

```ts
import { x402galFetch } from "@/lib/agentSdk";

// Automatically handles 402 → sign → retry
const res = await x402galFetch("https://your-app.com/api/ai/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: "What is water scarcity?" }),
  payerPrivateKey: process.env.AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  chain: "avalanche",
});
```

### Plug into any x402-hono resource server

*Use this if you are adding x402 payment gating to your own API server.*

```ts
import { xrplVerify, xrplSettle } from "./lib/x402XrplAdapter";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-hono";

app.use("/api/*", paymentMiddleware(priceInUsdc, {
  verify: xrplVerify,
  settle: xrplSettle,
}));
```

### Facilitator endpoint

*Use this if you want to call the x402GAL facilitator directly from any language or stack.*

```
POST https://your-deploy.com/api/x402/facilitate
Body: { requirement: X402Requirement, payload: X402Payload }

Response 200:
{
  usdcPulled: true,
  usdcTxHash: "0xb881...",          // Avalanche Fuji
  txHash: "5484EC...",              // XRPL swap
  retirementTxHash: "4E4795...",    // XRPL water credit
  simulated: false
}
```

## Configuration

> **⚠️ Security:** Never commit real seeds or private keys. Use `.env.local` (already gitignored) and [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) for CI/deployments. Use a secrets manager (Doppler, Vault) in production.

Copy `env.local.example` → `.env.local` and fill in:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `XRPL_ENDPOINT` | ✅ | XRPL node WebSocket (`wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233`) |
| `XRPL_TREASURY_SEED` | ✅ | Treasury (hot) wallet seed *(never commit!)* |
| `HYDROCOIN_ISSUER_SEED` | ✅ | Issuer (cold) wallet seed *(never commit!)* |
| `HYDROCOIN_ISSUER` | ✅ | Issuer wallet address |
| `HYDROCOIN_CURRENCY` | ✅ | Currency code (`HYD`) |
| `EVM_TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY` | ✅ | Treasury EVM key *(use `.env.local` + secret manager in production)* |
| `EVM_TREASURY_ADDRESS` | ✅ | Treasury EVM address |
| `AVALANCHE_NETWORK` | optional | `fuji` (default) or `mainnet` |
| `RPC_BASE` / `RPC_ETHEREUM` / `RPC_POLYGON` / `RPC_AVALANCHE` | optional | EVM RPC endpoints — public fallback used if absent |

## Footprint model — v2 boundary-aware WUE

```
W_site = WUE_site × [(T_in/1000)·e_in + (T_out/1000)·e_out + e_overhead] × F_boundary
```

Follows [Green Grid WUE v1](https://www.thegreengrid.org/) strictly — no double-counted cooling, GPU-boundary aware. Every `402` response embeds the full methodology block so auditors can re-derive the price independently.

**Defaults:** WUE 0.20 L/kWh · 200-in/500-out GPT-4-class call = **0.068 mL ≈ 18 HYDRO sub-units**

> **Note on units:** "HYDRO sub-units" are the smallest HYD denomination (analogous to cents), where 1 HYDRO = 1 US gallon of water restoration credit. We avoid the term "drops" here to prevent confusion with XRP drops (XRP's native smallest unit).

Methodology hash pinned at: [`sha256:7f27acc35d4e67bd50b60e894c30c51932d2318c6bc20ca8f38413d03122b6f0`](https://hydrocoin.com/whitepaper) — verify against the [HydroCoin MRV Framework](https://hydrocoin.com/whitepaper) to re-derive independently.
